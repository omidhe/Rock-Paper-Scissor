# Rock-Paper-Scissor

-- Step #1: Goal and General Algorithm Idea

Goal: write a game to play “rock, paper, scissors”
The user chooses one of these, the computer chooses the other
* If the pair is “rock, paper”, the paper wins
* If the pair is “scissors, paper”, the scissors wins
* If the pair is “scissors, rock”, the rock wins
Specification: user enters selection of rock, paper, scissors 
Program prints computer’s selection, who wins 
At end, computer prints number of games human won and it won

High-level design:
    initialize score
    loop
        ask user for choice
        if quit, exit loop
        computer selects one
        select winner and increment win count
    endloop
    print number of games user won, computer won, ties

-- Step #2: Data Representation and Program Structure

Part #1: Data

Represent the rock, paper, scissors using strings: “rock”, “paper”, “scissors” (sequence things)
Represent commands as strings as above, plus “quit” (sequence cmdlist)
Store the scores in a dictionary with keys “user”, “computer”, “tie” and integer values (initially set to 0)

Part #2: Functions

get user input – getuser()
get computer choice – getcomp()
determine winner – whowins()

Part #3: Refine algorithm

    while True:
        userchoice = getuser();
        if (userchoice == quit):
            break
        compchoice = getcomp();
        winner = whowins(userchoice, compchoice)
        score[winner] += 1
    print You won, score[“user”], game(s), the computer won, score[“computer”], game(s)
    print and you tied, score[“tie”], game(s)

-- Step #3: Figure out who wins

Represent (object1, object2) where object1 beats object2 as list of tuples, winlist. To see if user won, see if the (user-chosen object, computer-chosen object) tuple is in that list.

def whowins(user, comp):
    if user == comp:
        win = "tie"
    elif (user, comp) in winlist:
        win = "user"
    else:
        win = "computer"
    return win
    
-- Step #4: Get computer choice

Given the three objects in the sequence things, choose randomly.

def getcomp():
    pick = random.choice(things)
    print("Computer picks", pick)
    return pick
    
-- Step #5: Get user input

Loop until you get a valid input. If the user types an end of file (control-d) or an interrupt (control-c), act as though the user typed “quit”; report any other exceptions and then act as though the user typed “quit”.

def getuser():
    while True:
        try:
            n = input("Human: enter rock, paper, scissors, quit: ")
        except (EOFError, KeyboardInterrupt):
            n = "quit"
            break
        except Exception as msg:
            print("Unknown exception:", msg, "-- quitting")
            n = "quit"
            break
        *** check input ***
    return n
To check input, we need to be sure it’s a valid command, so see if it’s in cmdlist:

        if n not in cmdlist:
            print("Bad input; try again")
        else:
            break
Put these together to get the user input routine.
